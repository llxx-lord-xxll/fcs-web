                    <p class="text-center conference-topic-content">Entrepreneurship is the word of 2010s in the time of industrialisation 4.0 and generation X. From the time of garage style entrepreneurship startup hustling, to becoming a global movement of entrepreneurship, the need of the entrepreneurialism happens from education to industry development. How we do we understand the values behind? And how shall leaders take entrepreneurship to next level of development in coming future, to echo the changing need of a city? <br> The panel is collaborating leading organisations and rating magazines to explore the topics. It is probably one of the deepest discussion and learning in Asia about the future of entrepreneurship education that impacts everyone in the city.</p>
