              <h4>We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially when conducting business.</h4>

              <p>This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of the Site (“Visitors”) who visit without transacting business and Visitors who register to transact business on the Site and make use of the various services offered by Conference, Inc. (collectively, “Services”) (“Authorized Customers”).</p>

              <br>
